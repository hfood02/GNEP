# Hydrogen Bond Analyzer for XYZ Trajectories

This script analyzes hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) in molecular dynamics or quantum chemistry trajectories provided in extended XYZ format. It supports both conventional and unconventional H-bonds, including pi-H bonds (e.g., benzene rings, alkynes), dihydrogen bonds, and metal-H bonds.

---

## ðŸ§ª Theory

Hydrogen bonds are identified based on geometric criteria:

- The distance between donor and acceptor atoms (D...A) must be below a threshold (e.g., **< 3.5 Ã…**).
- The angle between Hydrogenâ€“Donorâ€“Acceptor must be sharp (e.g., **< 30Â°**).
- The Hydrogenâ€“Donor bond distance must be below a cutoff (e.g., **< 1.2 Ã…**).

Unconventional H-bonds are also recognized by geometry:

- **Ï€-H bonds**: H atom interacts with the Ï€ electron system (e.g., benzene ring, triple bond).
- **Dihydrogen bonds**: interaction between Xâ€“H and Hâ€“M (M = metal or boron).
- **Metal-H bonds**: H atom interacts with a metal atom.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Reads multi-frame `.xyz` trajectory files (supports periodic boundary conditions via `Lattice=`).
- Flexible donor and acceptor selection by **index** or **element type**.
- Automatic or manual detection of **Ï€ systems** and **metal centers**.
- **Parallel processing** for speed.
- Outputs per-frame H-bond counts and detailed geometric statistics.

## ðŸ“¦ Usage

Show all options:

```bash
python hbond.py -h
```

## ðŸ“‚ Outputs

- `hbond_count.txt`: Per-frame H-bond counts (regular and unconventional types)
- `hbond_geom_all.txt`: All H-bond geometries (frame, atom indices, distances, angles, type)
- Geometry distribution files: `Donor-Hydrogen_distribution.txt`, etc.
